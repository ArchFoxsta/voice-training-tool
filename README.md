# voice-training-tool
Hi, I just started this ambitious project and I hope others contribute and find it useful. I might setup a Ko-Fi or Patreon link if this project gains traction (I am very broke and need money T.T).

The purpose of this project is for trans people to have a tool that helps them train their voices. The goal is to analyze in real time:
Pitch
Resonance
Formants
Intonation
Timber
Word patterns

I am not that knowledgable with voice training and haven't made much progress on my own voice, so any advice would be super awsome! I have some experience with machine learning, so I might try to incorperate it at some point. I only know python, so this project will probably mainly be in python. Maybe I'll make an official app for people to use some day. Idk. One step at a time though.

This is also my first public project on GitHub, so if you have any advice for GitHub project, I would love to hear it!
